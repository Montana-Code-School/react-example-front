# React Create App with Tests

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

The original readme is in [here](./docs/CRA_README.md)

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run dev`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `npm test`

Will run the `enzyme` tests

Read more on enzyme testing harness [here](https://airbnb.io/enzyme/)

### `npm run test:user`

Will run the `puppeteer` tests

Read more on puppeteer testing harness [here](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/puppeteer)

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
